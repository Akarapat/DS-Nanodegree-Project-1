# DS-Nanodegree-Project-1
This project analyze Airbnb in Seattle in 2016.  It seeks to answer three questions in the context of stagnation of growth of income of middle class in the US.
- How many properties listed in Airbnb are owned by middle class?
- How many middle class are superhost?
- What are the benefit of being superhost?

It is found that significant proportion of properties listed in Airbnb are properly owned by middle income class.  However, relatively small portion of middle income class are superhost.  Middle income class should aspire to obtain superhost status on Airbnb as it would allow them to increase occupacy rate.

In this folder, a Jupyter notebook of the analysis is included.  Libraries used are pandas, numpy and matplotlib.  Other files included are data file of Airbnb in Seattle in 2016 retrieved from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle)
